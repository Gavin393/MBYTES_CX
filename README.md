# MBYTES_CX
This is a c–≥ack  on Malwarebytes, We like to call it MBYTES so it passes. 
The setup files are there, but you can run Alternative. Run "MBAMInstallerService" in the Alternative folder, Wait for it to install and then boom!
If it expires install another one of the copies in the Setup folder, If you run anything else in the alternative folder it would most likely fail and disrupt the installation. I imported my malwarebytes files into the alternative, I have a BitDefender file and i will get the setup soon and send it.
